170,bAjIrao mastAnI,"Synopsis__: For all the obvious problems (eg. historical accuracy, twisting the main characters) of the movie, it has the following merits:
* It presents the much neglected bAjI rAv in a way that is attractive to the general romantic audience. Such half-positive portrayals of brAhmaNa-s (and polygamy, and widows) is rare.
* bAjI rAv is presented as an alpha male. This is accurate, and again attractive.
* It shows period weaponry, the peshvA court, quite a few marATha + brAhmaNa mannerisms and refrains well.
* The hindu agenda of the marATha-s is not totally buried (despite the persistent anti-islamism mocking). It's easy to see in the early parts especially.
* Just in terms of simple dramatic quality, there is plenty of juice (which far exceeds the current star wars crap - https://www.facebook.com/vishvas.vasuki/posts/10153425133772989 ) - shRngAra (love) of the vipralambha type as well as the sambhOga type, vIra (many likable battle scenes), bIbhatsa (disgust at some people). Even the dialogues and poetry (recited and sung) were a pleasant surprise - there was some sophisticated use of ornamentation, such as upamA and anyokti.

Dr. Powell introduces him to a group of astrophysicists, to whom prot displays a level of knowledge that puzzles them. prot also exhibits total control over the other patients at the Institute, each of whom believes unquestioningly that he is indeed from K-PAX. prot, who claims to have journeyed to Earth by means of ""light-travel"", explains that he can take one person with him when he returns. Thereafter, most of the patients at the Institute ask to be taken by K-PAX on his journey back home.  Powell decides to subject prot to regression hypnosis, which works well. Using information gained from these sessions, Powell figures out that prot may simply be an alter ego of Robert Porter, a man from New Mexico whose life had been devastated by the murder of his wife and child in 1996.On July 27 as the hospital staff watch, the camera in Porter/prot's room cuts to static at the precise time prot said he would leave Earth. Powell finds Porter lying on the floor in his room, catatonic, prot having apparently left Porter's body for the light travel back to K-PAX.
The final scene's voiceover is prot explaining to Powell that the people of K-PAX have discovered that our universe will repeat its events again and again, so the mistakes we make will be repeated forever, and prot encourages Powell to make this time count as it is the only chance we have. With this in mind, Powell reconciles with his estranged son.

260,Life of Pi,"Synopsis__: The nature of myth, really. Story 1: A shipwreck leaves a Indian (hindu/ all religions are ok) boy (son of a rationalist father and veg spiritual mother), a tiger, a zebra with a broken leg, an orangutan, hyena on a life-boat. Hyena kills zebra for food, tries to kill the boy, later the Orangutan (distressing the boy). Tiger kills the hyena, eats leftovers of everything. Boy escapes and survives in self-made raft tied to boat, lives on rations, becomes non-veg, catches fish feeds tiger, rescues tiger from the sea when it jumps in sea to get to him. Tames tiger _eventually_. Sees beauty (bioluminiscence, clear water and skies, flying fish), fierce power and awe of strum and dang. Gets respite on a mangrove which turns deadly at night, reaches mexico.
Story 2: hyena: cruel but practical cook (makes raft to catch fish etc..). zebra with broken leg: sailor killed for bait. orangutan = boy's mother - accidentally killed by cook when arguing with hyena to leave boy alone. boy kills cook in rage (cook doesn't resist) - saddened to have been turned to a beast, but uses his carcass for bait. (deadly but respiteful island - represents some psychological state?)

Comments__: Stupendous climax despite hard-to-stand (for those like me) start. Rich in visual beauty.
Reaffirms the role of religous myth in understanding nature, human nature and hope (after abstracting away gory bloody lesser facts by allegory).
The hero, that  crafted such a deep, imaginatively rich allegory, HAD to be a hindu. Few other (extant, major) cultures can easily produce an equivalent.","dharma,Relationships, society and morals,Relationships, society and morals:dharma"

Towards the end the office guy discovers that the soap maker is himself - and he merges with him after a climax.

286,Rome,"Synopsis__: Reimagined story of Julius, Octavian, Octavia, Marcus Antonius, Pompeii, ...

My impression from it is that Julius and his adapted son Octavian can almost be seen as being ""vigrahavaan dharma"" (or atleast as close as can be expected from the barbarians). They, akin to their opponents Brutus, Cato and Cassius were primarily motivated by dharma (rather than kAma and mere artha). Similarly the stoic soldier Lucius Verinius. The opposition was dumbocratic, so misled. julius and Octavian (especially the latter) were not only right minded but also ruthless and able, as they ought to have been.
Pompey Magnus wanted artha and kAma tad too much. Marcus Antonius was entrapped in kAma. Cleopatra used kAma as a tool to pursue her dharma, according to their version.
The preta-background makers showed roman and egyptian paganism (as well as the jewish monotheism) fairly well, but their supercilious abrahamistic bias was clear in places (hard to expect anything better from them, perhaps).

287,Vikings,"Synopsis__: 

Frankly, it is hard to watch (for pagans) after 3.6. Born Again but becomes tolerable after around 4.4. They make Ragnar a crypto-Christian who conflates his admiration for the wealth and technological advancement of the Christianized territories (which they correctly hint as actually stemming from atleast the pagan Roman times), with a curiosity for preta-mata. While such phenomena might have been at work in the past, one would at least have expected heroes such as Ragnar (who can be compared with our own shALivAhana) to be more discerning. They should have assigned such idiocy to a lesser person. There are many other staunch pagan characters.
Later still, they make Ragnar an atheist, and the hearty pagan Floki tolerant of the maru intolerance.

Before that IMDB gives a rough guide as to what is watchable. There are a few snippets which give a glimpse into the rich Norse mythology.
Comments__: Good to watch shield maidens, seers, farmers, mild admiration of paganism, thwarted treachery.","Commentaries on (sections of) societies.,Relationships, society and morals,Relationships, society and morals:Commentaries on (sections of) societies."

Both violate rules and orders to ruthlessly eliminate the opposite side, and are quite comfortable with violence. They end up killing each other starting from a drug-murder trail. The associated rookie cop turns dirty after all this in the final scene.
Comments__: Classic shots.
But the rookies turn is rather nihilistic and depressing. Must be watched with care.","Commentaries on (sections of) societies.,Relationships, society and morals,Relationships, society and morals:Commentaries on (sections of) societies."
